                <ol>
                    <li>Cook the spaghetti in a large pot of salted boiling water until al dente.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium heat and cook the pancetta until crispy.</li>

                    <li>If the sauce is too thick, add some of the reserved pasta water to reach the desired consistency.</li>
                    <li>Season with freshly ground black pepper and serve immediately.</li>
